First, based on domain knowledge, human experts generate various local features on the circuit using predefined functions on netlist. Then, based on the generated features, a specific model, e.g. convolution neural network (CNN) model is designed to predict either the routing demand map or the congestion map\nthe emergence of Graph Neural Network (GNN) triggered applications of undirected homogeneous graphs models on routing congestion prediction, since a VLSI circuit can be naturally represented by a graph\nRouteNet-DRC Hotspot Prediction-ICCAD-2018-CNN # background:\nEvery chip design project must complete routing without design rule violation before tapeout.

The quality of a GR solution has a great impact on that of the resulted DR routing solution Congestion in a GR solution is one of the major causes of DRC violations in the DR solution since most of DRC violations are due to overcrowded wires and vias [1], [2] a better GR solution with less congestion is needed to lower the probability of getting DRC violations in advance. if the initial GR solution is not good and has a lot of congestion, the GR tool can hardly tackle the problem by rip-up and reroute. placement engines [3]–[5] which take routing congestion into consideration are applied FCN:FCN常用于图像中的每像素分类问题。采用任意输入大小，并产生大小完全相同的输出。GR拥塞预测也可以被视为任意大小的芯片设计上的像素二进制分类问题（拥塞与否）。因此，基于FCN的预测器可以自然地应用于PROS。 task:\nstage: post-placement, pre-route FCN based GR congestion predictor, use the predicted GR congestion to optimize the cost parameters of GR. predictor based parameter optimizer to generate a better GR solution. GR tools are driven by the cost parameters stored in each G-cell. When arriving at a G-cell g, the tool will compute the cost, called moving cost, to move to each of its neighboring G-cells and push these costs into a heap. With optimized cost parameters in G-cells, the GR tool can find better paths and allocate the routing resources to each net more smartly. PROS optimizes two types of cost parameters based on the prediction result, including overflow cost and wire/via cost . PROS will adjust the cost parameters in the projected congestion regions on all layers overflow cost wire/via cost: divided into two groups (small/large) according to their BBox sizes. Increasing the wire/via cost for small nets may be useless for congestion reduction and it may even increase the wire length or create new congestion due to detours out of the potential congestion region. In contrast, increasing the wire/via cost for large nets can be helpful since they can select another route within its BBox to completely avoid the potential congestion region CNN based wirelength estimator , By multiplying the predicted wirelength ratio and the precomputed FLUTE wirelength (训练一个系数).

Because this approach directly generates a multilayer global routing result, it can take the via cost into account during construction. However, this method may cost too much CPU time with a large problem size. (现在都用GPU做并行了，这种方法就变多了)\nsuch as\n2D + layer assigment: The other approach is to first compress a multilayer grid graph into a one-layer grid graph, then use a one-layer router to solve the one-layer global routing problem, and finally perform layer assignment to assign each wire in the multilayer grid graph\nThe edges corresponding to vias disappear in the one-layer grid graph. The capacity of each edge in the one-layer grid graph is obtained by accumulating the corresponding edge capacities in the three-layer grid graph\nThis approach can take advantage of many current full-fledged one-layer routers, e.g., [2]–[4], and use an affordable run time to generate an initial one-layer routing result. 本文主要针对layer assignment. 注意layer assignment 是对二维的所有边进行层分配。\nvias not only degrade the reliability and the performance of a design but also increase the manufacturing cost.\nprevious work’s layer assignment use greedy heuristics [8] or time-consuming integer linear programming methods [9] to minimize the via cost.\n像这种串行的还是要考虑net order, 越早布线的net越不会拥塞，net order很重要\ntask and contribution:\n这篇没有考虑优先方向（To simplify the presentation of our algorithm, we do not make any assumption about the preferred routing direction for each layer in the layer assignment problem.）不过也说明了这个工作能够很简单引用到考虑优先方向的情况 follow ISPD07 contest, 假设via的capacity是无限的（CUGR中明确了不进行这种假设） based on a one-layer routing result minimize via cost, WL and congestion overflow propose a polynomial-time algorithm: first generate net order , then solves the layer assignment problem can improve 3 winner of ISPD07 contest model\nCOngestion-constrained Layer Assignment (COLA)’s submodule\nNet order generation\nThe net order has a direct influence on the utilization of routing resources, so it is one of the key parts of COLA.\n对net进行打分决定order\n注意，线长越短，分数越高，net越应该先布线。解释：\nEemove Cycles\nArbitrarily remove.\n（为什么映射到第一层会有cycles？初始是怎么连起来的？没说？FLUTE算法是08年才出来，可能当时还没用上）\nSingle-net layer assignment （SOLA+APEC）\nSOLA(Singlenet Optimal Layer Assignment)\ndetermines an optimal layer assignment result without considering congestion constraints for a given net\ndynamic programming technique\n不考虑拥塞，这个方法能得到最好质量\nstep:\n01: for tree in layer 1, random select a pin as root, then use DFS or DFS to get a queue, so get the edge order.

It is based on sequential rip-up and re-route (RRR) and a lot of novel techniques. FastRoute 1.0 first uses FLUTE to construct congestion-driven Steiner trees, which will later undergo the edge shifting process to optimize tree structure to reduce congestion. It then uses pattern routing and maze routing with logistic function based cost function to solve the congestion problem. FastRoute 2.0 proposed monotonic routing and multi-source multi-sink maze routing techniques to enhance the capability to reduce congestion. FastRoute 3.0 introduced the virtual capacity technique to adaptively change the capacity associated with each global edge to divert wire usage from highly congested regions to less congested regions. FastRoute 4.0 proposed via-aware Steiner tree, 3-bend routing and a delicate layer assignment algorithm to effectively reduce via count while maintaining outstanding congestion reduction capability. FastRoute 4.1 simplifies the way the virtual capacities are updated and applies a single set of tuning parameters to all benchmark circuits.\nmodel\nflow\nNTHU Route 1.0- -TVLSI-2010- # NTHU Route 2.0- -TCAD-2013 # 2D\nNCTU GR 1.0-3D-congestion relaxed layer assignment- 2011- # it improved the scheme to estimate the realtime congestion more accurately by using a history term that will gradually wear off as the number of iterations increases if the overflow disappears.

A fine-grained maze routing will then search for a lowest cost path within the region. use its patching mechanism here.\nmodel\nGcell之间的容量等于track，一般GR表征via的容量是无限的，但是在本文中不是\nthree base definition:\nresource = capacity - demand 这三个变量在GCell和wire_edge上都有特征，也就是说有6个值 resource 能够直接表示拥程度 cost scheme\n主要分成wire和via两部分：\nwire cost:\n*wl*is wire lenght cost\neo is expected overflow cost, where uoc is hyper parameter, The larger d(u, v) is, the more likely it is to be congested. is accurate if the DR adopts the simplest strategy of picking a track randomly to route.

Use stripe mask to focus on bad cases for hub generation\nhub和pin连接阶段\n模型连接第一阶段生成的中心点，以获得最终的布线路由。这个过程可以被视为构建矩形稳定最小生成树（Rectilinear Steiner Minimum Tree，RSMT）的一部分。为了完成布线，模型遵循了一个基于强化学习（Reinforcement Learning，RL）的算法 REST。 在两阶段的过程中，作者还提出了一个多任务学习框架来提高生成中心点的质量。特别是，提出了一种新颖的条带掩模学习方法，旨在减轻噪声点案例可能造成的负面影响。算法的具体细节在附录 B 中给出。 detail router # DRCU\nacademic detailed\n综述 # ML4PR # Towards Machine Learning for Placement and Routing in Chip Design: a Methodological Overview\n放置和布线是两个不可或缺且具有挑战性的 NP-hard 问题\n机器学习凭借其数据驱动的性质显示出了广阔的前景，它可以减少对知识和先验的依赖，并且通过其先进的计算范式具有更大的可扩展性 (例如 GPU 加速的深度网络)\n挑战:\nplacement:\n在路由完成之前，无法评估诸如可达性之类的放置目标；因此，在优化循环中可能需要花费数小时才能获得反馈，这对于进行数千次查询来说是负担不起的 现代的放置器需要在几个小时内处理数万个宏和数百万个标准单元。这种可扩展性的要求仍然超出了现有 ML 方法的能力 routing:\n在公平的比较下，现有技术很难在效率和求解质量上系统地优于经典布线算法 大多数基于学习的技术在具有数千个网络的小型电路上工作得很好，而实际的布线引擎需要在超大型 3D 网格图 ( \u0026gt; 1000 × 1000 × 10 ) (\u0026gt; 1000 × 1000 × 10)(\u0026gt;1000×1000×10) 上有效地处理数百万个网络并产生高质量的解决方案 相关工作\nplacement\nRouting\n超大规模集成电路布线算法综述 # 超大规模集成电路布线算法综述\nbackground\n布线相关详细看routing2.md, 详细布线、面向可制造性设计的布线算法 还没记录\nEDA+GNN # 详细看 A Comprehensive Survey on Electronic Design Automation and Graph Neural Networks\n参考 # [AI技术带给EDA的机遇和挑战](AI技术带给EDA的机遇和挑战-Yibo Lin.pdf) [Towards Machine Learning for Placement and Routing in Chip Design: a Methodological Overview]([ 读论文] Towards Machine Learning for Placement and Routing in Chip Design: a Methodological Overview_toward machine learning\u0026hellip;.lake-CSDN博客) 【阅读】A Comprehensive Survey on Electronic Design Automation and Graph Neural Networks——EDA+GNN综述翻译_ppaml-CSDN博客 bak # CongestionNet-Congestion Prediction-IFIP-2019-GNN\n-placement Congestion prediction-arXiv-2021-GNN\n输入：网表\n输出：congestion at placement stage\nEDA-ML: Graph Representation LearningFramework for Digital IC Design Automation\n德雷塞尔大学电气与计算机工程系 Pratik Shrestha和Ioannis Savidis\nbackground\nVLSI : traditional methodologies -\u0026gt; ML,Graph representation learning ability to capture complex relationships in graph-structured data\nGNN：\ntask\nflow\ndata\n模型\n实验\n相关数据集 # only rtl # Home :: OpenCores # IWLS 2005 Benchmarks # openlane-examples: Examples from the Openlane repository # Global route # ISPD-2007 # the first published multilayer global routing benchmarks and the sizes of these benchmarks are large enough as compared to real industry cases has a two-layer and a six-layer version.

Site(最小布局单位) # SITE 的类别通常分为 core 和 pad，分别对应着 std cell 的 row 和 io cell 的 row。 SITE 的方向通常有 X，Y，R90 三个参数。X 代表可以沿 X 轴翻转，Y 代表可以沿 Y 轴翻转，R90 代表可以任意翻转。 SIZE 定义了 site 的宽度，通常 std cell 都是 site 的整数倍高度，宽度 Row(Standard/l0 cell 摆放位置) # 整数倍 Site Row 也有自己的方向，如上图箭头所示，通常相邻的 row 会 abut 且 flip，这样相邻 site 可以 共用一根电源线，节省 Power 资源。 Row Cut 问题 非整数倍 Row 低功耗设计 所有 std cell 都必须 snap 到 row 上面，这是最基本的 place 规则 默认的 std cell 摆放方向遵从 Row 的方向，即方向箭头一致，但是根据 cell 本身的 symmetry，std cell 的摆放位置也可以有如上图所示的选择 实际 design 中，我们还能经常见到一些其他种类的 row。常见的有 double height，trible height 的 row，用来摆放两倍高，三倍高的 cell。 一般我们只允许创建整数倍高的 row，而在 Voltage island 中，我们允许创建非整数倍高的 Row，比如默认电压区域用的是 9T 单元，而在 Voltage island 中我们使用了 12T 的 cell，这时候就需要创建非整数倍高度的 row EndCap, WellTap, Decap # 在后端物理设计中，除了与，非，或等一些常见的标准单元外，还有一些特殊的物理单元(physical cell)，它们通常 没有逻辑电路，不存在与 netlist 当中，但是对整个芯片的运行，稳定却起着举足轻重的作用。\nEndCap # 也叫 boundary cell， 拐角单元 是一种特殊的标准单元。 作用是确保每个 nwell 都是 nwell enclosed，类似一个封闭环。主要加在 row 的结尾(两边都要加)，以及 memory 或者其他 block 的周围包边 WellTap # welltap 是只包含 well contact 的 cell，将衬底接到电源和地网络，避免衬底悬浮。主要防止 CMOS 器件的寄生闩锁效应(latch-up)\n一般 tap cell 的作用范围是 30~40um, 即每隔 60um 左右放置一个 tap cell，具体的数据要参考艺商给的 document\nwell tap cell 一般交错摆放，类似棋盘分布。 Decap # Decap cell，去耦单元，这是一种特殊的 Filler cell。 当电路中大量单元同时翻转时会导致冲放电瞬间电流增大，使得电路 动态供电电压下降 或地线电压升高，引起动态电压降俗称 IR-drop。为了避免 IR-drop 对电路性能的影响，通常在电源和地线之间放置 由 MOS 管构成的电容，这种电容被称为去耦电容或者去耦单元，它的作用是在瞬态电流增大，电压下降时向电路补充电流以保持电源和地线之间的电压稳定，防止电源线的电压降和地线电压的升高。 Filler # 缓解 dynamic IR drop, eco\n通常是单元库中与逻辑无关的填充物\n可以分为 I/O filler(pad filler)以及普通的 standard cell filler.\npad filer，通常是用来填充 I/O 单元与 I/O 单元之间的空隙。为了更好的完成 power ring，也就是 ESD 之间的电源连接。通常是在 Floorplan 阶段时添加。\nstandard cell filler, 也是为了填充 std cell 之间的空隙。主要是为了满足 DRC 规则和设计需求，并形成 power rails。这个在 route 之前，之后加都可以。\nDecap cell，去耦单元，这是一种特殊的 Filler cell。\n当电路中大量单元同时翻转时会导致冲放电瞬间电流增大，使得电路 动态供电电压下降 或地线电压升高，引起动态电压降俗称 IR-drop。为了避免 IR-drop 对电路性能的影响，通常在电源和地线之间放置 由 MOS 管构成的电容，这种电容被称为去耦电容或者去耦单元，它的作用是在瞬态电流增大，电压下降时向电路补充电流以保持电源和地线之间的电压稳定，防止电源线的电压降和地线电压的升高。\n需要注意的是 Decap cell 是 带有 metal 层 的，为了不影响工具 routing resource，一般建议是最后 routing 全部结束后再加，加完之后再添加普通的不带 metal 的 filer.\nhard IP # hard IP 就是 macro\nmacro 有自己 单独的 lef 文件， 定义形状，pin 信息等等\nhard IP 一般有：SRAM/DDR/PLL/AD/DA\n常用原则\nMacro 一般摆放在芯片或模块(block)边缘 Macro 摆放时尽量缩短与其通信的 10 或 Macro 的距离 Macro 摆放时尽量缩短其 pins 与 standard cell 谡辑的距离 Macro 之间留够安全距离 重视 macro 之间的 channel，可以 abut 尽量 abut, channel 中在 place 时根据需求加入 soft blockage 标准单元区域尽量保持连续，不要产生小宽度的 channel; 长宽比接近 1 backbox # BlackBox 类似于一个 HardMacro，它内部的东西完全看不见，只是一个黑盒子，但是它又类似于一个 ModuleBoundary。它可以被改变形状，而且它可以被分配 pin 和被分割出去(partition)。如下图所示，灰色的形状就是 Black Box。\nBlackBox 是一种较为粗糙的模型，由于它看不见里面的东西，这样的结构使得它做任何 implementation 速度都很快，取而代之的精准度就会相对较低\ntrack, pitch # track # 走线轨道，信号线通常在 track 上 可以约束走线的方向 Std Cell 的高度通常用 metal2 track pitch 来表示，常用的 std cell 库有 7T/9T /12T，就是以 track 来区分的， 9T 就是说 std cell 的高度范围内可以走九条线，所以一般来讲， 7Tcell 的 size 最小， 9T cell 的 size 稍大。 布线时，往往第一层一般是水平，第二层垂直，相互交替 .lef 中定义如下，举例：\nLAYER M1 TYPE ROUTING ;#TYPE ROUTING代表这是一层走线层，我们还有其他的type包括Implant, Masterslice等. DIRECTION VERTICAL ; #DIRECTION代表这层Metal prefer走线方向，这边值得注意的是，每层track会分为pref track和non pref track。pref track就是这层layer上主流的走线方向，那剩下的non pref track就是非主流方向。因此上述例子中的主流走线方向就是vertical(纵向)，非主流就是横向(honrizontal)。通常。走non-pref track的wire会比较宽，这样就比较占用绕线资源。所以，一般不推荐使用non-pref track。特别是在先进工艺的设计中，绕线资源极其紧张，一般很少用到non-pref track. PITCH 0.090 0.064 #track之间的间距，垂直方向间距是0.09，水平方向是0.064. OFFSET 0.000 0.000 #第一条track偏离起始点的举例 MAXWIDTH 2; #WIDTH就代表默认这层layer上wire的宽度？MAXWIDTH就代表最高不能超过多少width WIDTH 0.032; Grid # Litho Grid，中文名，光刻格点。又被称为制造单元格点，这是 最基本的网格单元，任何元件都要对 Litho Grid 上，不然就无法被制造 它定义在 design 的 technology LEF. e.g.: MANUFACTURINGGRID 0.001;. 这就代表着改设计的制造单元格点间距为 0.001, 起始点是 Die Box 的 lower left 角上 Blockage, halo # Net, Wire # Net # 线网，也就是 Verilog 里的 wire(还有 tri、wor、trior、wand、triand、trireg、tri1、tri0、supply0、supply1) Wire\n后端工具中的 wire 指的是 net 的 物理化概念 每一条 net 在后端工具里面是由许多小段的 wire 组成，每一小段 wire 我们称之为 wire segment. wire 按照类型可以分为 Regular Wire(信号线)，Special Wire(电源线)，Patch Wire(补丁线)。 Regular Wire 就是我们平常见到的信号连线，连接各个 Siqnal Pin 的金属线段。每层金属层上的 Regular wire 默认的宽度都是一样的。 Special Wire 就是电源接地线，平常我们所见到的 power ring，stripes，power rail 等都是 Special Wire。一般用高层金属走线. Patch Wire，我们称之为补丁线。这是先进工艺中的一种走线，用于修复 Min Area，MinStep 等 DRC，不属于任何 net。 Pin # 引脚\n分为 Instance Pin, I/O Pin, Physical Pin, Partition Pin:\nInstance Pin: cell 的 pin\nI/O Pin: 模块输入输出，也叫 IO port\nPhysical Pin: Physical Pin 是 IO pin 具体物理化的信息，该引脚用于底层模块与上层模块拼接时的接口，类似一个纽扣一样，定义模块走线的起点和终点。它也是有具体的金属层参数信息，和普通 wire 一样。\nPartition Pin: 切分模块的引脚。用于在顶层模块未切分时，定义 physical pin 的位置，这个阶段的 physical pin，我们称之为 partition pin。和 Physical Pin 一样，他具有实际的金属层参数信息。\nplacement # 摆放标准单元，同时满足各种 constraint\n会删掉综合后加入的 buffer\n基础概念 # Tie High/Low\n电压转换\n尺寸越小越重要，静电\nGlobal/Detail Place\nDetail 是把 Global 后的单元放到网格上同时满足 constraint 要求\ndrv\nhvt 和 lvt\nHVT (High Voltage Threshold)：高电压阈值晶体管。这类单元库的特点是它们的阈值电压较高，因此它们在泄漏电流（leakage current）方面表现较好，也就是说 在静态功耗方面比较低。但是，它们的开关速度较慢，因此在性能（speed）方面不如低阈值电压的单元库。HVT 单元库通常用于对功耗要求较高的场合，但对性能要求不是非常高的地方。 LVT (Low Voltage Threshold)：低电压阈值晶体管。与 HVT 相反，LVT 单元库的阈值电压较低，这使得它们在开关速度上更快，因此性能较高。但是，这种速度的提升是以增加泄漏电流为代价的，也就是说它们的静态功耗较高。LVT 单元库通常用于对性能要求较高的设计中。 CTS # placement 后的

$rblkg_prefix 5_place_opt # setDesignMode\n-node，别称“超级开关”，是比较重要的一个设置，可以针对 某一种特定的工艺做一些基础的设置。它的选项很多，分别对应不同 Foundary 的不同工艺的区别，N 系列就是台积电的，S 系列就是三星的。。。\n-process，相比于-node，-process 是更 通用的设置，因为可以看到-node 里面的都是 20 以下的，此处用到的工艺是 45，所以使用更为通用的-process 45。在成熟的工艺中，都有特定的数字去代替，比如 40，28 等等。\n-topRoutingLayer,-bottomRoutingLayer. 就是告诉工具只能用哪些层进行绕线\nsetAnalysisMode\n-analysisType {single | bcwc | onChipVariation}\n其中(onChipVariation)模拟的 PVT 条件的偏差会更接近实际情况，会减少一些不必要的悲观量。\n一般都用 OCV\n-cppr 是关于 clock line 上的 common path 的一个处理方式\nsetOptMode\n-addInstancePrefix, -addNetPrefix\n工具在优化的过程中会增加很多新的 Cell，对于这些 Cell，我们希望他们都带一个我们能快速辨别他们的名字。也就是 Prefix（前缀）。当然，可以给 Instance 加 Prefix，那么也可以给 Net 加 Prefix\ne.g.:\nsetOptMode -addInstancePrefix \u0026#34;PRECTS_\u0026#34; -addNetPrefix \u0026#34;PRECTS_NET_\u0026#34; -powerEffort {none|low|high}\n-maxDensity -maxLength setTieHiLoMode\n这条命令本身只是去控制那些加的 Tie-high 和 Tie-low 的 Cell，也就是说在电路中某些地方电平需要拉高和拉低，就需要 专门的 Cell 去做这些连接。\n-maxFanout 2 ，就是设置一个 Tie cell 可以连接几个 Fanout。若设置的太大，可能出现的问题：需要拉高的时候拉不高，需要拉低的时候拉不低。若是设置的太小，可能导致 Tie Cell 最后局部的 density 会出现问题。 -honorDontTouch true ，就是设置为 honorDontTouch 的情况下到底要不要加 Tie，一般加的 DontTouch 都是工程师自己加的，也就是真的不希望动的地方，所以设置为 true -honorDontUse true，同上一样，是工程师真的不需要用到的，所以设置为 true。 -prefix “PRECTS_TIE_” , 给加的 Tie cell 加一个 Prefix（前缀）。便于识别。 -cell {TIEHI TIELO} 就是指定我们需要加的 Tie Cell 的类型 setNanoRouteMode\n这里的绕线是 global route\n-routeWithTimingDriven -true 也就是告诉工具在绕线的时候考虑时序。 group_path, setPathGroupOptions\n-effortLevel 对不同的 path group 的关注不一样，如此处，我们 关心 reg2reg，所以把 reg2reg 的 effortLevel 设置为 high set_dont_use_cells\n一般用于优化 PPA 的时候, 把一些面积大的, 功耗大的删掉\nset_clock_uncertainty\nset_clock_uncertainty 150 [all_clocks] -setup\nplace : jitter + clock skew + route correlation (si) + extra margin clock : jitter + route correlation (si) + extra margin route : jitter + extra margin signoff : jitter + extra margin set_max_transition\n一般可以按照 clock_cycle 的比例来定，对 clock 上面的 transition 一般定为 5%-8%，对 data 上面的 transition 一般定为 15%-20%\n库里面也有一些关于 max_transition 的限制, 但是往往比较宽松, 需要自己设置\n-clock_path xxx [all_clocks]\n-data_path xxx [all_clocks]\n-override, 覆盖其他地方的关于 max_transition 的设置\nplace_opt_design\n使用 GigaPlace 进行布局优化\n-expanded_views 就是告诉工具不要做 view 的 merge\n-out_dir 就是告诉工具输出的 path 放在哪个地方\n-prefix ”innovus_placeopt“\n6_CTS # set_ccopt_property\n查看 clk_buffer 种类：get_lib_cell *CLK*BUF*，一般不选 hvt buffer_cells clock_gating_cells use_inverters effort max_fanout target_skew target_max_trans target_insertion_delay route_type

基于 GNN 的架构优于其他模型和解决方案。上面列出的工作将他们的结果与浅层 ML、深度学习方法或特定任务的基线进行了比较。毫无疑问，GNN 的优越性是由于对拓扑和特征信息的考虑，这是以构建训练数据集的更大努力和更高的训练时间为代价的\nML对比 # shallow ML # [42] 中，基于 GNN 的模型解决方案优于用于二元分类的经典 ML 技术，例如线性回归器 (LR)、支持向量机 (SVM)、随机森林和 MLP。与商业工业工具相比，它在不丢失故障覆盖率的情况下，插入的测试点减少了 11%，测试模式帐户减少了 6%。 GNN-RE [4] 中，将基于 GNN 的模型与使用每个节点相同特征向量的监督分类任务的 SVM 进行比较。但是，根据定义，SVM 只考虑单个节点的特征，不能访问邻居节点的特征。 SVM 的训练时间几乎是 GNN-RE [4] 的 10 倍。然而，分类指标清楚地表明了 GNN 的优越性。 ParaGraph [46] 与 XGBoost [6] 和 LR 模型以及普通 GraphSAGE 进行了比较。预测准确率平均为 77%，比 XGBoost 好 110%，比 GraphSAGE 好 7%。 deep ML # D-SAGE [55] 与 MLP 和 vanilla GraphSAGE 进行了比较。**基于 GNN 的模型优于 MLP，强调结构信息与操作映射的相关性。**此外，由于边缘方向信息，D-SAGE [55] 相对于 GraphSAGE 获得了 17% 的相对增益。 定制的 ABGNN [22] 在输入和输出边界分类任务方面都优于普通 GraphSAGE、GAT 和图同构网络 (GIN) [62]，同时推理时间分别减少了 19.8% 和 18.0%。与使用电平相关衰减和 (LDDS)-存在向量 (EV) 来表示电路拓扑 [11] 的 NN 相比，ABGNN [22] 的性能也更高且运行时间更低 [49] 中，Circuit Designer [59] 与非基于图的 RL 架构进行了比较。不同的实验表明了 GCN-RL 的优越性，它在非基于图的 RL 永远不会收敛的情况下收敛，即使有非常多的模拟步骤。 Circuit Designer [59] 的成功也归功于考虑线性晶体管参数的明确特征向量 Compared to task-specific baselines. # GNN 的优势与两个因素有关：定义明确的初始特征和图学习能力 [39]。**定义明确的特征捕捉任务的基本特征，并为图学习提供宝贵的信息。 GNN 捕获特征和拓扑信息。**这与仅考虑图形连通性的方法相比，它具有明显的优势。\n在 PL-GNN [39] 中，与层次相关的特征用于学习哪些节点相似，而与记忆相关的特征有助于平衡关键路径。 PL-GNN [39] 优于基于模块化的聚类，后者仅使用连接信息\nCongestionNet [29] 的先验拥塞估计性能优于基线方法 29%，而对于较低层的拥塞估计则优于 75%。尽管如此，CongestionNet [29] 训练需要在单个 GPU 上进行 60 小时。在推理期间，130 万个单元的运行时间减少到 19 秒，少于基线方法的运行时间。\nEdge-GNN [44] 与开源全局布局工具 RePLAce3 [8] 和使用行业标准 EDA 工具的手动布局的结果进行了比较。在训练超过 10000 个芯片 loorplans 之后，Edge-GNN [44] 优于这两种方法，平均给出更低或相当的最差负松弛、总面积、功率和拥塞\nModels Depth #

Contest Introduction # Global routing is a critical component of the VLSI design process, exerting a substantial influence on circuit timing, power consumption, and overall routability. The efficiency of global routing is of paramount importance, as a swift and scalable approach can guide optimizations in early design stages like floor-planning and placement.\nOver the past decade, GPU accelerated computing platforms have been evolving into highly versatile and programmable systems capable of delivering immense parallel computing power. Recent studies have successfully leveraged GPUs to achieve over a 10x acceleration in global routing without compromising performance. Furthermore, machine learning (ML) techniques have been integrated into the global routing process, leading to enhanced routing solution quality.\nThe goal of this competition is to stimulate academic research aimed at developing a GPU/ML-enhanced global router tailored for industrial-level circuits. Notably, contemporary VLSI circuits often encompass tens of millions of cells, which is a significant departure from past global routing competitions that typically dealt with scenarios involving no more than 1 million cells. Due to the limitations of current routers, hierarchical or partitioning-based methods are commonly employed to manage large circuits, albeit at the risk of sacrificing a certain degree of optimality. It is of great importance to develop a scalable global router capable of handling circuits with tens of millions of cells, as it can greatly inform optimizations in the early design stages, such as floor-planning and placement. By fostering enthusiasm and innovation within the global routing research community, this competition aims to deliver substantial reductions in global routing runtime for these expansive industrial-grade circuits, harnessing the computational power of GPUs and the potential of machine learning techniques. Simultaneously, it strives to enhance the overall quality of routing results.\nInput/Output Formats and Evaluation # To enable teams from diverse backgrounds to participate, we have extracted routing resource information and netlist data from LEF and DEF files and organized them in simplified formats. Consequently, participants can approach the contest as a mathematical optimization problem within the GCell grid graph. The desired outcome is global routing solutions described within the GCell grid graph. The evaluation process is centered on several key metrics, including total wirelength, via count and routing congestion of the global routing solution, as well as the execution runtime of the global router.\nPlease check Introduction of the contest for more details.\nSubmission Guidance # We expect teams to package their global routers into Docker images.

又称概略布线,全局布线\n总体布线负责合理将每条线网的各部分分配到各个布线通道区中(也就是分配布线资源)并明确定义各布线问题\n总体布线的结果对详细布线的成功与否起到决定性作用,同时总体布线严重影响最后制造出来的芯片性能。\n一个经典图论问题\n整个芯片被分为多个区域 ，并将线网的连接关系对应到区域上 ，在区域间连线。由于全局布线不需要考虑版图设计 规则的约束 ，甚至不需要考虑大部分几何级问题 ，其布线模型的建模较为简单 ，即使在具有数以万计的区域的芯片版图上布线，也只产生较低的时间开销\n总体布线中首先将可布线区域划分成多个小格,每个格的布线资源使用带容量的边来表示,所有布线资源由一个网格图表示;再确定一个线网所占用网格图中的边,即线网的大致走线,将各线网合理地分配到各个网格中,以确保尽可能高的布通率。\n**总体布线图(Global Routing Graph, GRG)**将布线区域、每个区域内的布线容量、布线区域内的引脚信息以及不同布线区域之间的相互关系等信息抽象为一张图。不同的设计模式产生多种布线图模型,常见的布线图模型主要包括网格图模型、布线规划图模型以及通道相交图模型\n即使是最简单的问题,如一组两引脚线网在拥塞约束下布线,也是一个NP 完全问题。\n全局布线的主要目标是为后续的详细布线提供指导 ，从而降低布线问题的复杂程度 ，减少整体的时间开销。作为整个布线任务中多种优化目标的主要影响因素 ，全局布线要在给定布线资源的情况下 ，优化线长、通孔数及关键线网时延等目标函数\n评价全局布线算法的主要指标有线长、通孔数、溢出数 量、运行时间\n布线图模型 #

通道相交图模型 # 算法 # 最早用于解决总体布线图上的最短路径问题的是1959年出现的Diikstra算法,该算法的时间复杂度为 O(n^2^)\n后来发展为迷宫系列算法，缺乏寻找最优解的能力，不适用VLSI\n多引脚网分解 # 多引脚线网分解常用于总体布线算法。具有两个以上引脚的线网通常被分解成两个引脚的子网,然后每个子网的点对点布线以某种串行方式执行。这种线网分解是在总体布线开始时执行的,这会影响最终布线结果的质量。许多总体布线都采用多引脚线网分解。分解多引脚线网的两种流行方法是RSMT构造和最小生成树(Minimum Spanning Tree,MST)构造。RSMT 通常提供较短线长的树状拓扑结构,而 MST 由于产生更多的工形双引脚线网而提供更大的灵活性。\n最小树算法 # Steiner 最小树算法 # 多端点线网的总体布线可定义成寻找 Steiner 树问题,精确算法、传统启发式算法、计算智能方法都可用于求解 Steiner 树。\n在VLSI总体布线问题中,多端线网的总体布线问题是寻找一棵连接给定引脚集合的布线树问题,而 Steiner 最小树相对于其他方法所得的布线树来说具有更小的布线树总线长。因此,Steiner最小树被看作总体布线问题中多端线网的最佳连接模型,并且在总体布线图上的Steiner 最小树算法是所有总体布线算法的基础。\n精确算法包括动态规划技术、拉格朗日松弛法、分支界限法等。虽然从理论上能够得到问题的精确解,但是问题规模越大,精确算法越难求解问题。继而研究工作开始转向启发式策略。遗传算法、蚁群算法、鱼群算法、粒子群优化算法等计算智能方法在求解 Steiner 问题中展示出了广阔的应用前景。\n近年来,随着计算能力的增强,加之高性能电路的设计需要,版图设计技术也将随之改进。出于增强电路的性能的目的,研究人员提出新型互连结构,即非曼哈顿互连结构,非曼哈顿结构 Steiner 树则应运而生。\n然而,精确算法受其复杂度限制不适用于求解非曼哈顿结构 Steiner 树这类NP难问题,而贪心策略致使传统启发式算法极易过早收敛。据所查找的资料文献中,目前将计算智能方法应用到求解该NP难问题的研究工作还较少。\n整数线性规划布线 # 慢\n拆线重步 # 在确定了一组线网的初始布线后,通常会发现一些布线资源被过度使用了。然后,现有的布线被拆开,重新分配到一个迭代修复框架中,这个框架被称为“拆线重布”。现代整数线性规划工具帮助基于整数线性规划的总体布线在数小时内成功完成数十万条布线。然而**,商业EDA 工具需要更大的可扩展性和更少的运行时间**。在布线阶段,如果一个线网无法布线,通常是由于物理障碍或其他布线线网占用了它的路径。核心思想是允许临时违规,直到所有线网都被布线。也就是说,迭代地拆开一些线网,并以不同的方式重新对它们布线,以减少违规的数量。如果一次只处理一个网,那么这个策略就是串行法,所以线网的串行处理对最终解的质量影响很大。 文献[31]对于每一个违规的线网定义了拆线重布的成功率,并且只对最有希望改进的线网重布线。然而**,若一个线网在没有违规的情况下不能布线,那么成功率需要重新计算。这是非常昂贵的,尤其是对于大规模的设计。**拆线重布通常与其他总体布线方法相结合,作为进一步提高布线质量的后处理步骤。\n协商拥塞布线 # 层分配问题 # 层分配在可布线性、时序性、串扰性和可制造性方面起着至关重要的作用。如果特定层分配的导线数量过多,则会加剧拥塞和串扰。此外,如果总体时序关键线网被分配到较低层,则时序由于导线宽度/间距较窄而恶化。差的层分配产生的大量通孔,其比线需要更大的面积和更宽的间距,进而导致可布线性/引脚访问问题。对于纳米设计,最小化通孔数量尤为重要,因为通孔故障是关键的可制造性问题之一。层分配是多层总体布线中的关键步骤,因为它将二维总体布线的结果映射到原始的多层解空间。现代集成电路或芯片通常是多层结构。在布线时,大多数布线器通常不会在三维空间中直接布线。相反,它们在二维平面上布线,然后通过层分配技术将二维布线结果恢复到三维空间。有些工作是基于动态规划实现的,此外,BoxRouter 2.0实现了一种复杂的线性规划技术,可以根据二维投影恢复三维布线,并根据三维布线结果优化二维布线器。**层分配的目标通常是保持二维总体布线的总溢出,然后最小化通孔数量。**在层分配中考虑天线效应,通过适当地将导线分配到较高的金属层(不一定是顶层),可以有效地减少天线违规\n一个k层的布线区域可以被划分为一大批的总体布线块并建模成为k层网格图G^k^(V^k^,E^k^)。其中k表示布线层的数量,V ^k^表示第k层网格总体布线单元的集合,E^k^表示第k层的网格布线边,其中每条边表示相邻布线块的边界。相邻层的连接边表示通孔。一条网格边的容量定义为可以经过相邻布线块的布线轨道数。\n层分配定义：\n串行和并行方法 # 串行 # 布线多个线网的最原始和最简单的策略是选择特定的顺序,然后按该顺序布线线网。这种方法的主要优点是:在布线当前线网时,可以知道并考虑前期布线线网的拥塞信息。例如,在将多引脚线网分解成两引脚线网的早期算法中,使用绕障迷宫布线或线路探测布线等方法来对每个线网布线。在这些方法中,单元边界对路径搜索开放,直到所有的路径都被先前考虑的线网占据。在这一点之后,边界被视为障碍。顺序法的缺点是解的质量很大程度上取决于线网的处理顺序,很难找到好的顺序。在任意特定的顺序下,由于过多拥塞,很难对后期的线网布线。\n此外,没有反馈机制允许这些线网将信息反馈给前期布线的线网,以便为后期布线的线网留下一些区域。文献[109]提到没有一种单一的线网排序方法始终表现良好。尽管对于线网的排序问题上存在争议,但在串行布线上已经有了一些很好的研究成果,主要是通过迭代循环将后期布线的线网的拥塞信息反馈给前期布线线网\n虽然串行方法、拆线重布以及其他启发式方法在实践中可能是有效的,但是它们不能提供关于是否存在可行解决方案的具体答案。换句话说,如果这些方法不能找到可行的解决方案,不清楚这是因为可行的解决方案不存在,还是因为启发式方法的缺点。另外,当启发式方法找到可行解时,不知道解是否最优,与最优解相差多远。？\n依据预先给定的线网顺序对线网进行布线,布线过程中先布线网会抢占后布线网的布线资源,不同的布线顺序可能会生成完全不同的布线结果。早期的一项研究指出,在布线开始之前找到一个最优布线顺序是NP难问题,且不存在一个在所有情况下都达到最优的布线顺序选取策略叨。对所有线网同时进行布线的同时布线算法可以避免线序对布线结果的影响。\n策略：\n按端点数量的升序布线。端点数量较多的线网往往会造成内部空间的拥塞。 按线长升序布线以降低容量溢出 ，提升可布性。线长较短的线网布线范围比较小 ，灵活性有限 ，而线长较长的线网则可以在更大范围内绕路 ，寻找更优解。 按线长降序布线以降低总体时延。优先布线长较长的线网 ，降低线长较长 的关键线网对总体时延的影响 ，以提升电路的总体性能。 依据预估的拥塞程度布线 ，优先对较为拥塞的区域内的线网进行布线 并行 # 在串行方法中,路径是根据预定的顺序一次生成的。串行方法是非常快速的，但由于它们的串行性质会导致次优解。并发方法试图利用总体优化方法来解决问题。这些方法可以提供电路布线的总体视图,但需要相当长的时间。从计算复杂性的角度来看,所有网络的并发布线是一个**复杂的问题。使用整数线性规划是实现这一目标的方法之一。**事实上,总体布线问题的数学模型可以修改为 0-1整数规划问题。线性规划由一组约束和可选目标函数组成。这个函数根据约束判断是最大还是最小。约束和目标函数都必须是线性的。这些约束形成了一个线性方程和线性不等式的系统。整数线性规划是一种特殊的线性规划,其中每个变量只能取整数值且都是二进制的,故称为0-1整数线性规划。\n基于并发方法的总体布线器包括对布线区域拥塞的评估,产生了高质量的布线。另外,舍弃可能处于拥堵区域的路径,以减小整数线性规划的输入规模。\n多商品流(multi-commodity flow，MCF)算法将布线问题看作是一个多商品流问题回,并将其建模成整数线性规划(integerlinear programming,ILP)问题进行求解。\n两端线网与多端线网 # 两端线网 # 迷宫布线算法 # 及其变体 A*算法：一般通过设计开销函数来躲避拥塞。开销函数的值往往在边界上穿过的金属线数量接近及超过边容量时迅速增大[9]，迷宫布线类算法具备着极其强大的拥塞避免能力 ，可以对单个线网给出质量极高的布线结果 ，但即使通过开销函数定向减小搜索空间 ，迷宫布线类算法仍然会产生较高的时间开销\n模式布线 # 使用预先设计的模式对两端线网进行布线 ，常用的模式有 L 型（1 拐点）、Z 型（2拐点）[10]与 U 型（2 拐点 ，绕路连线） 由 于路径的搜索空间远小于迷宫布线 ，模式布线类算 法具备极快的布线速度 ，但其布线结果相对较差 。对于跨越 m × n 网格的两端线网 ，L 型模式仅在两种布线⽅式中选取代价较低的一种 ，而 Z 型模式会考虑 m + n 种不同的布线⽅式。因此 ，Z/U 型模式避免拥塞的灵活性要远大于 L 型算法 ，但相应地 ，其单个线网的布线时间复杂度更高\n单调布线 # 随布线问题复杂度的上升 ，L/Z/U 型模式布线已经不能满足问题的需求 。，其布线路径单调地向右上 （ 左 下 ）或 左 上（ 右 下 ）搜 索 ，可 以 搜 索 到 (m + n - 2)!/ (m - 1)!(n - 1)! 种布线⽅式 ，且时间复 杂度与 Z 型相同 ，为 O (mn)，但由于其走线拐点较 多，其布线通孔数会增加。\n三拐点布线（3-bend routing）， # 其路径支持最多 3 个拐点 ，且可以绕路布线。三拐点布线同样使用 O (mn)的时间复杂度 ，具备与迷宫布线相近的拥塞避免能力 ，且由于其最多使用 3 个拐点，极大地减少了通孔数\n多端线网 # 很难直接使用迷宫布线或模式布线进行求解，主流的解决⽅法是最小斯坦纳树\nsteiner最小树算法 # 给定平面上的点Steiner 最小树通过一些 Steiner 点将这些点连接起来,以获得最小的总长度。\nSteiner 最小树(Steiner Minimum Tree,SMT)作为超大规模集成电路物理设计的基本模型之一,可以应用于布图规划、布局和布线阶段。\n作为一个标准的计算机问题，业界一般将布线问题代为Steiner最小树问题\nSteiner最小树问题是一个NP难问题\nSteiner 最小树通常用于物理设计中非关键线网的初始拓扑创建。最小化线长不是时序关键线网优化的唯一日标。然而,大多数线网在布线阶段是不重要的，Steiner 最小树给出了这种线网最理想的布线形式。因此,在布局规划和布局期间,Steiner 最小树通常被用来精确评估拥塞和线长。\n对单个线网的布线,是物理设计中的一个基础问题。无论是总体布线还是详细布线,都会用到线网布线。线网布线又根据线网引脚的个数分为两引脚线网布线和多引脚线网布线。考虑到布线长度最小化,两引脚线网布线在布线图中就转换为最短路径问题,而多引脚线网布线转换为直角 Steiner 最小树(RectilinearSteiner Minimal Tree,RSMT)问题\n拥塞图与拆线重布（rip-up and reroute) # 随着问题复杂度的上升 ，全局布线的布线资源越来越紧张 ，直接进行布线会发生大量无法避免的溢出\nFastRoute[9]使用 FLUTE 算法生成的 RSMT 计算出拥塞图 ，并依据此拥塞图重新构建 RSMT\n在拥塞图的初始化阶段 ，对所有两端线网分别进行拥塞程度计算。若两端点在水平或竖直⽅向具有相同的坐标 ，则直接将拥塞图上两端点间所有的边的拥塞程度加 1.0 。 否则 ，对于两⽅向上坐标都不相同的线网 ，计算其两种可能的 L 型连接⽅式 ，并将两种可能的路径上的边的拥塞程度都加 0.5\n拥塞图的初始化阶段过后 ，由于所有 L 型连接⽅式都在拥塞程度上平均分配 ，在拥塞程度较大的区域 ，拥塞程度可能会超过其容量。为了更好地规划拥塞图的拥塞分布 ，使用一个快速的拆线重布 ，依次将各 L 型连接的两端线网提供的拥塞程度去除后 ，选择拥塞程度更小的一条路径 ，并将此路径的拥塞程度加 1.0。\n拆线重布（rip-up and reroute）策略在初次布线完成后 ，对发生溢出的拥塞区域的线网进行拆除 ，并迭代地调整线序多次重新布线 ，直到溢出不再减少 ，或达到运行时间限制为止。\n一般来讲 ，在初始布线时使用模式布线 ，这样在大量简单线网上拥有极快的布线速度 ，在拆线重布阶段 ，使用迷宫布线类算法 ，或时间复杂度较高的模式布线算法 ，以尽可能地提升重布线网的灵活性 ，并减少溢出次数 ，从而在整体的运行速度和布线质量间取得平衡\n优化目标 # 主要是以减小通孔数量，还要考虑时延问题\n随着器件尺寸迅速缩小,互连延迟对芯片性能产生了至关重要的作用。因此，最小化线路长度和延迟变得越来越重要。由于互连延迟已成为决定系统性能的主要因素,仅考虑拥塞已经不够。在布线过程中,加入时序约束和功耗约束更符合实际工业制造,无论是理论研究还是实际生产都具有重要意义。\n主要研究方向 # 减少拥塞数和溢出数 考虑延时、串扰、拥塞等优化目标 非曼哈顿结构 并行 总体布线器 #

李氏算法（迷宫布线算法） # 该算法从源点开始 ，依次访问网格各⽅向上的相邻节点 ，并为该节点标记从源点到该点的已知布线代价。对每个访问到的节点重复相同的过程。这会在整个布线图中产生一个连续扩散的波 ，当这个波扩散到了目标点 ，即目标节点被他的相邻节点访问到时 ，就找到了这样一条路径连通源点与目标点。随后算法进入路径回溯阶段 ，从目标点开始 ，直到回溯到源点，此时就生成了一条最优路径\n这类方法都是每次从线网（nets)中选择一条拆成两端线网来进行布线，效果取决于布线顺序。另外，算法未考虑约束（可布性、拥塞、间距），而这些约束都有滞后性，需要线网全部布线完成后，才能体现。因此基于以上方法的工作更多在顺序布线（sequential routing)前期就考虑各种约束[1-5]。\nA*算法 #

Given its complexity, the routing process is typically divided into two stages: global routing and detailed routing. Global routing, the initial stage, establishes coarse-grained wire paths for signal nets, thereby providing valuable guidance for the subsequent detailed routing stage, enhancing its efficiency. Detailed routing, on the other hand, focuses on identifying valid physical paths, primarily within the routing guides set by global routing, while taking into account design rule constraints\nRouting is usually divided into global routing (GR) and detailed routing (DR) –cite–\u0026gt; C. J. Alpert, D. P. Mehta, and S. S. Sapatnekar, Handbook of Algorithms for Physical Design Automation. CRC press, 2008. Routing is usually divided into global routing (GR) and detailed routing (DR) [2]. Global routing serves as a fast routing planning to generate guidance for detailed routing to reduce the search space of each net. Detailed routing then takes the guidance as input and finishes the physical wiring to connect pins in each net. Global routing is also used for routability estimation at early design stages like placement [3–9]. With growing design scales and complexity, it becomes increasingly challenging for global routing to resolve routing overflow within a short time. Therefore, the quality and efficiency of global routing is critical to design closure, as it impacts both its proceeding and succeeding design stages.\nbackground # 输入 # 输出 # 优化指标 # 约束 # 线网连接正确性 布线障碍 版图设计规则 ：金属线的最小宽度（min-width）；金属线间及金属线与布线障碍间的最小线间距（min-spacing）；一条金属线的最小面积（min-area），当金属线的宽度固定为最小宽度时 ，最小面积约束也被称作最小长度约束 Global Router # 概念 # 甚至不需要考虑大部分几何级问题 ，其布线模型的建模较为简单 ，即使在具有数以万计的区域的芯片版图上布线，也只产生较低的时间开销\nroutes every net with only two pins under design constraints turns out to be an NP-complete problem –cite–\u0026gt; M.

Additionally, the impact of vias on delays is difficult to model with simple metrics. Inter-wire coupling capacitance can also cause significant discrepancies between actual and nominal timing responses and power consumption\nProblem Formulation # In global routing, a 3D routing space is defined using global routing cells (GCells), created by a regular grid of horizontal and vertical lines. This configuration results in the formation of a grid graph where each GCell is treated as a vertex and edges connect adjacent GCells within the same layer (GCell edges) or between GCells in neighboring layers (via edges). The global router needs to establish a concrete path for each net within the grid graph and optimize the routability, timing and power.\nFor each testcase, the global router starts with a placed design, and generates a global routing solution. The global routing solution is evaluated by OpenROAD, which reports timing, power, and routing congestion. Additionally, the runtime and memory efficiency of the global router are critical factors.\n文件 # 输入\nFor each testcase, two sets of input files are provided: industry-standard files and simplified files.\nThe industry-standard files include DEF, LEF, LIB, and SDC files. The DEF file contains definitions for CORE, ROW, TRACKS, and GCELLGRID, along with placed COMPONENTS and unrouted NETS. Similar to the ICCAD2019 global routing contest, GCells are specified using the definition from the DEF GCELLGRID section. The LEF file includes MACRO definitions and technology information. The LIB files offer timing and power data for library cells, while the SDC files provide timing constraints. These files serve as the raw input, allowing contestants to perform the most accurate routing resource and performance modeling.\nFor each circuit, we also provide a set of simplified input files, which include a routing resource file (with a .cap extension) and a net information file (with a .net extension). The routing resource file follows the same format as used in the ISPD2024 contest, while the net information file is an extended version of the one used in ISPD2024. The routing resource file offers a detailed representation of the GCell grid graph and its available routing resources.

FTP 不提供任何安全通道来在主机之间传输文件；而SFTP协议提供了一个安全通道，用于在网络上的主机之间传输文件。\nX11 # X11（X Window System）是一种位图显示的视窗系统，X表示X协议，11是协议版本号。X 协议主要由 X server 和 X client 组成\n术语客户端-服务器——你的终端是\u0026quot;服务器\u0026quot;，而应用程序是 “客户端”——这一概念经常困扰X的新用户。本地的X显示程序提供显示服务，所以它扮演了服务器；远端应用程序使用了该服务，所以它是客户端。\n例如我通过ssh-X来启动X11 forwarding:连接到远程服务器，远程服务器有python程序调用 matplotlib绘制图形，那这个时候服务器端的程序就是X应用程序，他通过X协议告诉我们本地的 Xserver如何在我们本地的电脑上显示图形（如果我们本地安装有相应的X11实现的话）。\nSSL #

野指针和空指针 # 空指针: 如 int *p = NULL 这就定义了一个指针，通常NULL是一个零值，操作系统定义内存64kb以下的内存单元是不可访问的，所以像如 *p = 9 这样给他赋值是系统不允许的，将会发生内存报错。\n野指针: 如 int *p就是一个野指针，可以看到它在创建时没有赋初值，所以它的值是一个随机数，也就是乱指一气，通常都是指向了不合法的内存段，所以使用它也会内存报错。还有指针p被free或者delete之后也会成为野指针，因为它所指的内存空间被释放之后，变成了一个不合法内存段。野指针，它顾名思义它就是一个野指针，它是没有主人领养的野兽，凶猛残暴，用它你就得自食其果。\n指针的魅力 # 场景1：使一个字符串颠倒顺序 # void reverse(char *_str,int _l) //反转函数,_l指要反转字串的长度 { char *p=_str,*q=_str+_l-1,temp;\t//指针直接得到值 while(q\u0026gt;p) { temp=*p; *p=*q; *q=temp; p++; q--; } } void reverse(char *_str,int _l) //反转函数,_l指要反转字串的长度 { int i=0,j=_l-1,temp; while(j\u0026gt;i) { temp=str[i]; str[i]=str[j]; str[j]=str[i]; i++; j--; } } 这样并不比上面用迭代器的情况好，而且要糟很多，因为这样用str[i]，str[j]的下标的方式访问元素时，需要先对str所存的数组首地址进行一次加减运算才能正确得到第i个、第j个值（读者可在任何一款编译器上进行反汇编查看），上面一共出现了5次下标访问str元素，情况可想而知。\n场景2：函数传递 # typedef struct structType { int i; char arr[100]; }structType; //一个print函数的定义： void print0(const structType data) { //printf something about data } //另一个print函数的定义： void print1(const structType *pdata) { //printf something about data } print1比print0有明显的效率优势，因为print0是值传递，当值传进去时，必须要开辟一个structType那么大的内存空间来乘装这些值，这就要相当大的一部分资源消耗，而print1是指针传递，传进去的是地址，一个地址只需4字节内存空间，使用时解析其指针即可，因此它比print0更高效更实用。\n场景3 # 在C++中，使用std::vector存储类对象时，你可以选择存储对象的实例（直接存储变量）或者对象的指针。这两种方式各有优缺点：\n直接存储对象（对象实例） # 优点：\n简单易用：不需要管理内存，std::vector会自动管理对象的生命周期。 性能：不需要额外的间接寻址，直接访问对象。 安全性：对象生命周期由std::vector管理，减少了内存泄漏的风险。 缺点：\n拷贝开销：当对象较大时，复制对象可能会有性能开销。 灵活性：如果需要存储不同类型的对象，可能需要使用虚函数和基类指针。 存储对象指针 # 优点：\n灵活性：可以存储不同类型的对象，只要它们继承自同一个基类。 性能：对于大型对象，存储指针可以避免复制开销。 缺点：\n内存管理：需要手动管理对象的内存，容易出错。 间接寻址：访问对象属性或方法时需要额外的间接寻址，可能会有轻微的性能开销。 复杂性：代码复杂度增加，需要考虑对象的创建和销毁。 选择建议 # 如果对象较小且不需要存储多种类型的对象，直接存储对象实例通常更简单、更安全。 如果对象较大或需要存储多种类型的对象，存储指针可能更合适，但需要小心管理内存。 vector\u0026amp;数组\u0026amp;链表与栈\u0026amp;堆 # 数组 # 用来存储固定大小的同类型元素的序列\n特点 # 固定大小：创建时需要指定数组的大小，之后无法更改。 随机访问：可以直接通过索引快速访问任何元素，时间复杂度为 O(1)。 高效的内存利用：由于连续的内存分配，数组在内存利用和访问速度方面非常高效。 插入/删除操作耗时：在数组中间插入或删除元素通常需要移动其他元素，因此这些操作的时间复杂度较高。 数组的限制：数组的大小在声明时必须确定，且不能改变，数组不提供检查越界的机制，访问无效索引可能导致未定义行为。 vector # 向量（Vector，如 std::vector）随机访问快，时间复杂度为 O(1)，插入/删除操作慢，在末尾快，但在中间或开始较慢，内存动态分配，可以根据需要改变大小，但可能涉及复制整个数组到新的内存位置。适用场景：当需要动态数组，即数组大小可以改变的场景，需要随机访问，但也会有在末尾添加或删除元素的操作场景。\n特点 # 动态大小：向量可以在运行时根据需要扩展或缩减其大小。 随机访问：与数组一样，向量支持通过索引的快速随机访问。 自动管理内存：向量在内部管理内存，自动扩展和缩减存储空间。 可能的重新分配开销：当向量扩展到超过当前分配的内存时，它可能需要重新分配整个内存块来存储元素。 由于动态扩容，向量的内存使用可能不如静态数组高效， 在频繁扩容的情况下，性能可能受到影响。 链表 # 链表是一种由节点组成的数据结构，每个节点包含数据和指向下一个节点的指针，链表中的元素不必在内存中连续存储，这种情况下频繁插入和删除时，链表会更加高效，但是不支持随机访问，访问特定索引的元素需要从头开始遍历，效率较低。\nC++ 标准库提供了两种链表类型：std::list：双向链表 和 std::forward_list：单向链表\nstd::forward_list 提供了单向链表的实现，适合于需要频繁在头部插入或删除元素的场景。由于其单向特性，它在内存使用上比 std::list 更高效，但也牺牲了一些灵活性，如无法直接访问前一个元素。\n特点 # 动态大小：链表的大小可以根据需要动态变化。 高效的插入和删除：可以在任何位置快速地插入或删除节点，不需要移动其他元素。 无随机访问：访问链表中的元素需要从头开始遍历，时间复杂度为 O(n)。 额外的内存开销：每个节点需要额外的存储空间来存储指针。 智能指针 # 内存泄漏\u0026amp;悬空指针 # 举例 # void foo(int n) { int* ptr = new int(42); ... if (n \u0026gt; 5) { return; } ... delete ptr; } void other_fn(int* ptr) { ... }; void bar() { int* ptr = new int(42); other_fn(ptr); // ptr == ? } 在foo函数中，如果入参n \u0026gt; 5, 则会导致指针ptr的内存未被正确释放，从而导致内存泄漏。\n在bar函数中，我们将指针ptr传递给了另外一个函数other_fn，我们无法确定other_fn有没有释放ptr内存，如果被释放了，那ptr将成为一个悬空指针，bar在后续还继续访问它，会引发未定义行为，可能导致程序崩溃。\nunique_ptr # 在超出作用域时，会自动释放所管理的对象内存\n#include \u0026lt;memory\u0026gt; #include \u0026lt;iostream\u0026gt; class MyClass { public: MyClass() { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;MyClass constructed\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; } ~MyClass() { std::cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;MyClass destroyed\u0026#34; \u0026lt;\u0026lt; std::endl; } }; int main() { std::unique_ptr\u0026lt;MyClass\u0026gt; ptr1(new MyClass); return 0; } MyClass constructed MyClass destroyed\nshared_ptr # shared_ptr是C++11提供的另外一种常见的智能指针，与unique_ptr独占对象方式不同，shared_ptr是一种共享式智能指针，允许多个shared_ptr指针共同拥有同一个对象，采用引用计数的方式来管理对象的生命周期。当所有的 shared_ptr 对象都销毁时，才会自动释放所管理的对象。\nBugs # 1. # vector var1[m][n];//不行 vector\u0026lt;vector\u0026lt;vector\u0026raquo; var2[m][n]；//可以\n//当wire_max_level和wire_max_sublevel较大(1000）时，初始化第258和259行的 “IntVec dst[wire_max_level][wire_max_sublevel];IntVec dst_ports[wire_max_level][wire_max_sublevel];”会报错：Segmentation fault\n在C++中，这两种声明方式涉及到多维向量的初始化和存储方式，它们之间存在一些关键的差异：\nvector var1[m][n]; 这种声明方式试图在栈上创建一个二维数组，其中每个元素是一个 vector。这种声明是非法的，因为标准C++不支持非静态数组大小的非固定大小数组（non-POD types，即包含构造函数、析构函数、虚函数等的类型）作为数组元素。std::vector 是一个非POD类型，因为它有动态内存管理和其他资源管理的需求。\n问题： 栈溢出：如果 m 和 n 较大，这种声明可能会因为栈空间不足而导致编译错误或运行时错误（如段错误）。 未定义行为：在C++标准中，这种用法是未定义的，因为 vector 需要动态内存分配，而数组的静态内存分配无法满足这一需求。\nvector\u0026lt;vector\u0026lt;vector\u0026raquo; var2[m][n]; 这种声明方式创建了一个三维向量，其中最外层是一个数组，每个元素是一个二维 vector 的向量。尽管这种声明在语法上是合法的，但它仍然存在效率和安全性问题。\n特点： 堆分配：尽管 vector 通常在堆上分配内存，但这种声明方式实际上在栈上创建了一个指向 vector 的指针数组，每个指针指向一个在堆上分配的 vector。 内存管理：这种方式需要手动管理内存，因为数组中的每个 vector 指针都需要适当地构造和析构。 性能问题：每次访问 var2[i][j] 时，实际上涉及到两次内存访问：一次是从数组中获取指针，另一次是从 vector 中访问数据。\n参考 #

堆栈简称为栈。\n堆栈存储器的主要特点 # 固定大小： 当涉及到堆栈内存时，其大小保持固定，并在程序执行开始时确定。\n速度优势： 堆栈内存帧是连续的。因此，在堆栈内存中分配和释放内存的速度非常快。这是通过操作系统管理的堆栈指针对引用进行简单调整来完成的。\n控制信息和变量的存储： 堆栈内存负责容纳控制信息、局部变量和函数参数，包括返回地址。\n有限的可访问性： 请务必记住，存储在堆栈内存中的数据只能在活动函数调用期间访问。\n自动管理： 堆栈内存的高效管理由系统本身完成，不需要我们额外的工作。\n举例 # 堆栈段为空\n1共 9 个\n为主函数创建一个新的堆栈帧\n2共 9 个\n在 main 函数的堆栈帧中，局部变量 x 现在的值为 5\n3共 9 个\n调用 add 函数，实际参数为 (5, 10)\n4共 9 个\n控制权转移到 add 函数，为 add 函数创建一个新的堆栈帧，其中包含局部变量 a、b 和 sum\n5共 9 个\nadd 函数的堆栈帧上的 sum 变量被分配 a + b 的结果\n6共 9 个\nadd 函数完成其任务并且其堆栈帧被销毁\n7共 9 个\n具有可变结果的主函数的堆栈帧存储从 add 函数返回的值\n8共 9 个\n在显示结果值（此处未显示）后，主功能块也被销毁，并且堆栈段再次为空\n堆(Heap) # 也称为动态内存\n是内存分配的野孩子。程序员必须手动管理它。堆内存允许我们在程序执行期间随时分配和释放内存。它非常适合存储大型数据结构或大小事先未知的对象。\n举例 # 栈段和堆段为空\n1共 7 个\n为主函数创建一个新的堆栈帧\n2共 7 个\n局部变量值被赋予值 42\n3共 7 个\n在堆上分配了一个指针变量ptr，指针ptr中存放的是分配的堆内存的地址（即0x1000）！\n4共 7 个\nvalue变量中存储的值（即42）被赋值给ptr指向的内存位置（堆地址0x1000）\n5共 7 个\n堆上地址 0x1000 处分配的内存被释放\n6共 7 个\nmain函数的栈帧从栈中弹出（显示result的值后），栈段和堆段再次清空\n7共7 个\n第 3 行： main 调用该函数，并为其创建一个新的堆栈帧。 第 5 行： 堆栈帧上的局部变量 value 被赋值为 42 。 第 8 行： ptr 使用关键字为堆上的单个整数动态创建的内存分配给指针变量 new 。我们假设堆上新内存的地址为 0x1000。分配的堆内存的地址（0x1000）存储在指针中。 ptr 。 第 11 行： 将整数值 42 分配给 ptr （堆地址 0x1000）所指向的内存位置。 第 12 行：( ptr )指向的内存位置存储的值 42 被打印到控制台。 第 15 行： 使用关键字释放在堆上地址 0x1000 处分配的内存 delete 。在此行之后， ptr 成为悬空指针，因为它仍然保存地址 0x1000，但该内存已被释放。然而，对于这个重要的讨论，我们不会详细讨论悬空指针。 第17行： main函数返回0，表示执行成功。 第 18 行： 从堆栈中弹出主函数的堆栈帧，并释放所有局部变量 ( value 和)。 ptr 注意：C++ 标准库还提供了一系列智能指针，可以帮助自动化堆中内存分配和释放的过程。\n特征 # 大小的灵活性： 堆内存大小可以在程序执行过程中发生变化。 速度权衡： 在堆中分配和释放内存速度较慢，因为它涉及寻找合适的内存帧和处理碎片。 动态对象的存储： 堆内存存储具有动态生命周期的对象和数据结构，如 new Java 或 C++ 中使用关键字创建的对象和数据结构。 持久数据： 存储在堆内存中的数据将一直保留在那里，直到我们手动释放它或程序结束。 手动管理： 在某些编程语言（例如C和C++）中，必须手动管理堆内存。如果处理不当，可能会导致内存泄漏或资源使用效率低下。 对比 # 大小管理： 堆栈内存具有在程序执行开始时确定的固定大小，而堆内存是灵活的，可以在程序的整个生命周期中更改。 速度： 堆栈内存在分配和释放内存时具有速度优势，因为它只需要调整引用。相反，由于需要定位合适的内存帧并管理碎片，堆内存操作速度较慢。 存储目的： 堆栈内存指定用于控制信息（例如函数调用和返回地址）、局部变量和函数参数（包括返回地址）。另一方面，堆内存用于存储具有动态生命周期的对象和数据结构，例如 new Java 或 C++ 中使用关键字创建的对象和数据结构。 数据可访问性： 堆栈内存中的数据只能在活动函数调用期间访问，而堆内存中的数据在手动释放或程序结束之前仍然可以访问。 内存管理： 系统自动管理堆栈内存，优化其使用，以实现快速高效的内存引用。相比之下，堆内存管理是程序员的责任，处理不当可能会导致内存泄漏或资源使用效率低下。 数据结构 # 堆栈(Stack) # 堆栈简称为栈。一种线性表数据结构，是一种只允许在表的一端进行插入和删除操作的线性表\n我们把栈中允许插入和删除的一端称为 「栈顶（top）」；另一端则称为 「栈底（bottom）」。 表中没有任何数据元素时，称之为 「空栈」。 栈的插入操作又称为「入栈」或者「进栈」 栈的删除操作又称为「出栈」或者「退栈」。 栈是一种 「后进先出（Last In First Out）」 的线性表，简称为 「LIFO 结构」。 堆栈的基本操作 # 初始化空栈：创建一个空栈，定义栈的大小 size，以及栈顶元素指针 top。\n判断栈是否为空：当堆栈为空时，返回 True。当堆栈不为空时，返回 False。一般只用于栈中删除操作和获取当前栈顶元素操作中。\n判断栈是否已满：当堆栈已满时，返回 True，当堆栈未满时，返回 False。一般只用于顺序栈中插入元素和获取当前栈顶元素操作中。\n插入元素（进栈、入栈）：相当于在线性表最后元素后面插入一个新的数据元素。并改变栈顶指针 top 的指向位置。\n删除元素（出栈、退栈）：相当于在线性表最后元素后面删除最后一个数据元素。并改变栈顶指针 top 的指向位置。\n获取栈顶元素：相当于获取线性表中最后一个数据元素。与插入元素、删除元素不同的是，该操作并不改变栈顶指针 top 的指向位置。\n堆(Heap) # 参考 # 堆栈与堆（Stack vs Heap）：有什么区别？图文并茂拆解代码解析！_内存_存储_函数 (sohu.com)\n静态和动态链接 # 编译分三步：\n预处理（宏、#include、预编译指令#ifdef等）生成.i文件 编译，生成.s汇编文件 汇编，将汇编语言翻译为二进制机器语言 ​ 静态链接和动态链接两者最大的区别就在于链接的时机不一样，静态链接是在形成可执行程序前，而动态链接的进行则是在程序执行时，下面来详细介绍这两种链接方式。\n静态链接 # 原理 # 将所有.c/cpp文件独立编译生成的.o进行链接从而形成可执行程序\n​ 我们知道，链接器在链接静态链接库的时候是以目标文件为单位的。比如我们引用了静态库中的printf()函数，那么链接器就会把库中包含printf()函数的那个目标文件链接进来，如果很多函数都放在一个目标文件中，很可能很多没用的函数都被一起链接进了输出结果中。由于运行库有成百上千个函数，数量非常庞大，每个函数独立地放在一个目标文件中可以尽量减少空间的浪费，那些没有被用到的目标文件就不要链接到最终的输出文件中。\n优缺点 # 浪费空间\n另一方面就是更新比较困难，因为每当库函数的代码修改了，这个时候就需要重新进行编译链接形成可执行程序。\n在可执行程序中已经具备了所有执行程序所需要的任何东西，在执行的时候运行速度快。\n动态链接 # 将程序按照模块拆分成各个相对独立的部分，程序运行到时才链接\n假设现在有两个程序program1.o和program2.0，这两者共用同一个库lib.o,假设首先运行程序program1，系统首先加载program1.0，当系统发现program1.o中用到了lib.0，即program1.o依赖于lib.o，那么系统接着加载lib.o，如果program1.o和lib.o还依赖于其他目标文件，则依次全部加载到内存中。当program2运行时，同样的加载program2.0，然后发现program2.o依赖于lib.o，但是此时lib.o已经存在于内存中，这个时候就不再进行重新加载，而是将内存中已经存在的lib.o映射到program2的虚拟地址空间中，从而进行链接(这个链接过程和静态链接类似)形成可执行程序。\n动态链接的优点显而易见，就是即使需要每个程序都依赖同一个库，但是该库不会像静态链接那样在内存中存在多分，副本，而是这多个程序在执行时共享同一份副本；另一个优点是，更新也比较方便，更新时只需要替换原来的目标文件，而无需将所有的程序再重新链接一遍。当程序下一次运行时，新版本的目标文件会被自动加载到内存并且链接起来，程序就完成了升级的目标。但是动态链接也是有缺点的，因为把链接推迟到了程序运行时，所以每次执行程序都需要进行链接，所以性能会有一定损失。\n​ 据估算，动态链接和静态链接相比，性能损失大约在5%以下。经过实践证明，这点性能损失用来换区程序在空间上的节省和程序构建和升级时的灵活性是值得的。\n参考 #

在C++中，std::thread（标准线程）的性能主要受以下几个因素影响：\n线程创建和销毁的开销（Overhead of Thread Creation and Destruction）：每次创建或销毁线程都会带来一定的开销。这是因为操作系统需要为每个线程分配和回收资源，如栈空间、线程局部存储等。因此，频繁地创建和销毁线程可能会导致性能下降。 线程切换的开销（Overhead of Thread Switching）：操作系统通过线程调度器来管理多个线程的执行。当一个线程的执行被暂停，另一个线程被唤醒时，就会发生线程切换。线程切换会带来一定的开销，因为需要保存和恢复线程的执行环境。 线程同步的开销（Overhead of Thread Synchronization）：在多线程环境中，通常需要使用同步机制（如互斥锁、条件变量等）来协调线程的执行。这些同步操作也会带来一定的开销。 为了减少这些开销，我们可以采取以下策略：\n线程池（Thread Pool）：通过预先创建一定数量的线程，并重复使用这些线程，可以减少线程创建和销毁的开销。 减少线程切换（Reduce Thread Switching）：通过合理地设计程序，减少不必要的线程切换，可以提高性能。 减少锁的使用（Reduce Lock Usage）：通过使用无锁数据结构或者减少锁的粒度，可以减少线程同步的开销。 多线程真的能加速？ # 线程的调度是根据cpu的算法，如果线程的运算量不大，cpu 算法调度线程不一定会平均分配给每个内核的\n测试代码创建了四个线程，四个线程都遍历一百万次。通过使用JDK自带监控工具：Visual VM 查看线程的执行过程\npublic class ThreadTest { private static final int num = 1000 * 1000; public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException { new Thread(()-\u0026gt;{ for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; num; i++) { System.out.println(i); } },\u0026#34;线程1\u0026#34;).start(); new Thread(()-\u0026gt;{ for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; num; i++) { System.out.println(i); } },\u0026#34;线程2\u0026#34;).start(); new Thread(()-\u0026gt;{ for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; num; i++) { System.out.println(i); } },\u0026#34;线程3\u0026#34;).start(); new Thread(()-\u0026gt;{ for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; num; i++) { System.out.println(i); } },\u0026#34;线程4\u0026#34;).start(); } } 发现，多个线程根本没有并发执行，而是不断的在线程之间 上下文切换！也就是说，4个线程都是在单个内核执行，其他的内核并没有工作\nthis_thread #

Python 提高性能的方法 # 使用 JIT 编译器（如 PyPy）代替 CPython。 关键代码用 C/C++ 编写，并通过扩展（如 Cython、SWIG）调用。 使用并行库（如 multiprocessing）绕过 GIL。 2. C++ 提高开发效率的方法 # 使用现代 C++（如 C++11/14/17）特性（如智能指针、自动类型推导）。 借助库（如 Boost）减少手动开发复杂性。 总结 # 特性 C++ Python 性能 高，适合高性能需求 较低，适合快速开发 开发效率 较低，语法复杂 高，语法简洁 类型系统 静态类型，编译时检查 动态类型，运行时检查 内存管理 手动管理，精准控制 自动管理，简单易用 生态系统 底层开发库丰富，适合高性能应用 第三方库广泛，适合数据科学与快速开发 适用场景 游戏开发、嵌入式系统、实时应用 数据分析、机器学习、脚本工具 对于需要高性能或与硬件交互的任务，C++ 是更好的选择；而 Python 则适合对开发效率要求较高的场景，如快速原型、数据分析和机器学习。\n"},{"id":20,"href":"/zh/docs/Other/ReadtheDocs/","title":"Readthe Docs","section":"Other","content":" Read the Docs # Read the Docs 是一个基于 Sphinx 的免费文档托管项目\nSphinx # Sphinx 是一个基于 Python 的文档生成项目\nSphinx 使用 reST(reStructuredText) 作为标记语言, 通常采用 .rst 作为文件后缀\n安装最新版本的 Sphinx 及依赖 # pip3 install -U Sphinx\r#other relate installer\rpip3 install sphinx-autobuild\rpip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme\rpip3 install recommonmark\t#sphinx markdown支持工具\rpip3 install sphinx_markdown_tables\rpip install sphinxcontrib.mermaid #mermaid渲染插件\rpip install myst-parser\t#markdown语法支持插件\r#安装完成后，系统会增加一些 sphinx- 开头的命令。\r#sphinx-apidoc sphinx-autobuild sphinx-autogen sphinx-build sphinx-quickstart sphinx_rtd_theme 网站搭建 # 1.install # [安装最新版本的 Sphinx 及依赖](#安装最新版本的 Sphinx 及依赖)\n2.创建项目 # sphinx-quickstart\ry\rproject_name\rv0\rzh_CN 输出文件 # Makefile：可以看作是一个包含指令的文件，在使用 make 命令时，可以使用这些指令来构建文档输出。 build：生成的文件的输出目录。 make.bat：Windows 用命令行。 _static：静态文件目录，比如图片等。 _templates：模板目录。 conf.py：存放 Sphinx 的配置，包括在 sphinx-quickstart 时选中的那些值，可以自行定义其他的值。 index.rst：文档项目起始文件。\nmake html#就会在 build/html 目录生成 html 相关文件 3.sphinx-autobuild 工具启动 HTTP 服务 # sphinx-autobuild source build/html\r默认启动 8000 端口，在浏览器输入 http://127.0.0.1:8000 #注意：搭一个简单服务器的时候，选择在终端直接Ctrl+z而不是使用Ctrl+c\r#Ctrl+c 直接停止当前执行的命令．\r#Ctrl+z 挂起当前执行的命令 ERROR: [Errno 98] error while attempting to bind on address (\u0026#39;127.0.0.1\u0026#39;, 8000): address already in use\r#解决方法 windows\r$netstat -ano | findstr :8000\r#返回\r#TCP 127.0.0.1:12126 127.0.0.1:8000 FIN_WAIT_2 20580\r$taskkill /F /PID 20580 3.修改样式 # Sphinx Themes Gallery (sphinx-themes.org)\nconf.py 文件，找到 html_theme 字段，修改为“sphinx_rtd_theme”主题。\n4.edit with .md # .rst 文件就是网站内容\n在 project_name/source/. 中新建文件用来存放你的所有 markdown 在 index.rst 中修改 maxdepth, 数量为文件内文件层数 再在下方添加文件夹名称/index 每一层都需要有 index.rst 文件 .. toctree::\r:maxdepth: 3\r:caption: Contents:\rmydoc/index 5.github托管 # 上传到github仓库(build文件夹可以不上传) Project Dashboard | Read the Docs上传 参考 # Read the Docs 从懵逼到入门-CSDN博客\nSphinx+gitee+ReadtheDocs搭建在线阅读文档系统_哔哩哔哩_bilibili\nGithub + Sphinx+Read the docs 实战入门指南（一） - 知乎 (zhihu.com)\n【小沐学Python】Python实现在线电子书制作（MkDocs + readthedocs + github + Markdown）_爱看书的小沐-CSDN博客\nreadthedocs/tutorial-template: Template for the Read the Docs tutorial (github.com)例程\n"},{"id":21,"href":"/zh/docs/Other/Tools/","title":"Tools","section":"Other","content":" WSL # cmd # wsl -l -v wsl --shutdown\t#关闭 wsl --list --verbose # 查看已安装的发行版、WSL 版本信息和当前状态 wsl --set-default \u0026lt;DistroName\u0026gt;
